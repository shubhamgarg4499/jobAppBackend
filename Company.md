ur description:

## Flow Overview

1. **/list/:id** and **/listall**:
   - **Requirement**: Only the **Token** is required.
   - These routes allow authenticated users to retrieve company details or a list of all companies.

2. **/create**:
   - **Requirement**: Both **Token** and the user must be a verified **Employer**.
   - Any verified employer can create a new company by submitting the necessary details. 
   - After the company is created, an **Admin** needs to add the user who created the company to the **employers** list of that company.

3. **/delete** and **/addEmployer**:
   - **Requirement**: Both **Token** and the user must be an **Admin**.
   - Only an Admin can delete a company or add an employer to a company.
   - The Admin will be responsible for managing which users are part of the companyâ€™s employer list.

4. **Creating Jobs**:
   - After creating a company, only those users who are added to the **employers** list of that company can create jobs related to that company.
   - This ensures that only legitimate employees (as defined by the company's employer list) can post jobs for that company.

### Sequence of Actions:

1. **Employer creates a company**:
   - An authenticated **Employer** sends a **POST request** to **/create** with the required details.
   
2. **Admin adds the Employer to the company's employers list**:
   - After the company is created, an **Admin** uses the **/addEmployer** route to add the Employer's user ID to the **employers** list of that company.

3. **Employer creates a job**:
   - Once the Employer is added to the company's employer list, they can create jobs related to the company.
